Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2:
What is HTTP?
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web and it is used in all browsers to load web pages.
Browser sends an HTTP request to web server when navigating to an URL. The HTTP command then provides an HTTP response to the web server with the webpage contents.
Browser -> URL -> Database
Browser <- webpage <- Database
What is HTTP/2?
HTTP/2 is the upgrade version of HTTP, and it was launched in the year 2015 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). 
key differences between HTTP/2 has to HTTP/1 are
1) In HTTP/1 data is transferred in text format but in HTTP/2 uses binary protocol.
2) HTTP/2 is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking: if I am downloading a file and it has multiple recourses, HTTP/1 will wait for one file to finish downloading before starting the next file but HTTP/2 supports multiplexing, which allows multiple files to be downloaded simultaneously.
3) HTTP/2 uses header compression to reduce overhead with helps to improve overall performance.
4) HTTP/2 allows Server Pushing to add responses proactively into the Browser cache.
5)HTTP/2 can use one connection for parallelism allowing multiple requests and responses to occur concurrently

Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects in JavaScript are reference data types, storing a reference or pointer to the location in memory where the object resides. Loosely defined as an unordered collection of related data in the form of "key: value" pairs, objects can include properties (variables) and methods (functions).
ex:
let car(){
	name: "Tata";
	model: "Nexon";
	colour: "Red";
};

var result = function (arr) {
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
          if (arr[i] % 2 != 0) {
            console.log("Anonymous Function: " + arr[i]);
          }
        }
      };

In JavaScript we can create a object using object literal
ex:
let model = {name: 'Tata', model:'Nexon', colour:'Red'};
