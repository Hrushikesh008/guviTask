Diffrents between window object and document object

    The document object operates within the scope of the current HTML document, focusing on its structure and content. The window object operates globally, affecting the entire browser environment.
    Document is primarily used for DOM manipulation and accessing elements within the document, while window handles browser-specific tasks like navigation and timing.
    The document object is a property of the window object. You can access it as window.document or simply document.
